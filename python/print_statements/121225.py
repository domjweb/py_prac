# This is a single line comment in Python
'''
This is a multi-line string in Python that serves as a comment
if it is not used in any meaningful way.
'''

# Below is a print statement that will produce the word "Hello."
print("Hello.")

# Below is a function statement that will produce the word "Hello!"
def hello():
    print("Hello!")
hello()
'''
Not a print statement but I wanted to test function calling
and refresh my memory.
